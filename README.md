## HubNet Web Extension

The HubNet Web Extension is a NetLogo extension that allows JavaScript clients to connect to NetLogo. Hopefully, this includes iPhones and iPads as well. 

This is experimental, proof-of-concept type code. It is not actively maintained.

## UC Davis version

see also https://github.com/cjt8109/hubnet-web-extension , which includes both a fresher version of the server code and “an expanded JavaScript client that runs on iOS devices”
